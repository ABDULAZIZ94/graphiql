**Note**: If you are having webpack issues or questions about webpack, make sure you've cross-referenced your webpack configuration with our own [webpack example](../examples/graphiql-webpack) first. f you are having webpack issues or questions about webpack, make sure you've cross-referenced your webpack configuration with our own [webpack example](../examples/graphiql-webpack) first. We now have tests in CI that ensure this always builds, and we ensure it works end-to-end with every publish.

Using another GraphQL service? Here's how to get GraphiQL set up:

## Getting Started 

With `npm`

```shell
npm install --save graphiql
```

Alternatively, if you are using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
yarn add graphiql
```

GraphiQL provides a React component responsible for rendering the UI, which should be provided with a function for fetching from GraphQL, we recommend using the [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) standard API.
