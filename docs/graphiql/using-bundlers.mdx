# NPM Example (For bundlers)

**Note**: If you are having webpack issues or questions about webpack, make sure you've cross-referenced your webpack configuration with our own [webpack example](../examples/graphiql-webpack) first. f you are having webpack issues or questions about webpack, make sure you've cross-referenced your webpack configuration with our own [webpack example](../examples/graphiql-webpack) first. We now have tests in CI that ensure this always builds, and we ensure it works end-to-end with every publish.

Using another GraphQL service? Here's how to get GraphiQL set up:

With `npm`:

```shell
npm install --save graphiql
```

Alternatively, if you are using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
yarn add graphiql
```

GraphiQL provides a React component responsible for rendering the UI, which should be provided with a function for fetching from GraphQL, we recommend using the [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) standard API.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import GraphiQL from 'graphiql';
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';

function graphQLFetcher(graphQLParams) {
  return fetch(window.location.origin + '/graphql', {
    method: 'post',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(graphQLParams),
  }).then(response => response.json());
}

ReactDOM.render(<GraphiQL fetcher={graphQLFetcher} />, document.body);
```
