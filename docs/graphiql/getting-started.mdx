Build for the web with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [browserify](http://browserify.org/), or use the pre-bundled `graphiql.js` file. See the [cdn example](../examples/graphiql-cdn/) in the git repository to see how to use the pre-bundled file, or see the [webpack example](../examples/graphiql-webpack) to see how to bundle an application using the `GraphiQL` component.

### GraphiQL for my GraphQL Service/HTTP Server/Etc

You may be using a framework or runtime that already provides graphiql, or that provides it via a middleware or plugin.

For example, we support [`express-graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)!

Here are some example searches:

- https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=graphiql - ~117 hits
- https://pypi.org/search/?q=graphiql - ~33 hits
- https://search.maven.org/search?q=graphiql - ~15 hits
- https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=graphiql - ~6 hits
- https://godoc.org/?q=graphiql - ~12 hits
- https://packagist.org/?query=%22graphiql%22 - ~5 hits
- https://crates.io/search?q=graphiql - ~2 hits

This doesn't include runtimes or libraries where GraphiQL is used but isn't referenced in the package registry search entry.

### CDN Bundle

Don't forget to include the CSS file on the page! If you're using `npm` or `yarn`, you can find it in `node_modules/graphiql/graphiql.css`, or you can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/releases).

For an example of setting up a GraphiQL, check out the [example](../examples/graphiql-cdn/) in this repository which also includes a few useful features highlighting GraphiQL's API.

The most minimal way to set up GraphiQL is a single `index.html` file:

`embed:graphiql-cdn/index.html`

**Notes**:

- the inlined styles are important for ensuring GraphiQL is visible and fills the canvas.
- using `React.createElement` directly is belaborous, so follow the webpack instructions below for more highly customized implementation -->
